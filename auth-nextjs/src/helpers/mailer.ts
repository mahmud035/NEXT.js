// IMPORTANT: Which API route pattern should I follow?

// It's depends. If I want to verify the user from Back-End, then I need to follow the first route pattern. Contrary, if I want to verify the user from Front-End, then I need to follow the second route pattern.

// 1. domain.com/verifyToken/adasdasiafk (BACK-END VERIFY)
// 2. domain.com/verifyToken?token=adasdasiafk (FRONT-END VERIFY)
